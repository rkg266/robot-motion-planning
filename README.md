# Robot Motion planning 
Study and compare search-based (A*) and sampling-based (RRT) algorithms to find short and safe path for a robot in a 3D space with obstacles.

## Problem statement
We aim to solve a deterministic shortest path problem in a continuous 3-D Euclidean space. The obstacles are Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB). We assume the robot is a point object. As the 3-D space is not changing during the robot motion, we can consider it to be the configuration space where we employ path search algorithms.

## Results
There are 7 different 3D enivironments - Single cube, Maze, Flappy bird, Monza, Window, Tower and Room. Paths were generated by both A* and RRT algorithms. <br>
Few of the generated paths are shown below: <br>
