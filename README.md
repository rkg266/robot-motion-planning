# Robot Motion planning 
Study and compare search-based (A*) and sampling-based (RRT) algorithms to find short and safe path for a robot in a 3D space with obstacles.

## Problem statement
We aim to solve a deterministic shortest path problem in a continuous 3-D Euclidean space. The obstacles are Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB). We assume the robot is a point object. As the 3-D space is not changing during the robot motion, we can consider it to be the configuration space where we employ path search algorithms.

## Results
There are 7 different 3D enivironments - Single cube, Maze, Flappy bird, Monza, Window, Tower and Room. Paths were generated by both A* and RRT algorithms. <br>
Few of the generated paths are shown below: <br>

## Running the code:
Libraries: numpy, rtree, matplotlib, pqdict, math

Files: 
1. main.py
2. Planner.py
3. astar.py
4. rrtAlgo.py
5. src (directory) -> code sourced from https://github.com/motion-planning/rrt-algorithms
6. maps (directory) -> Map environments
7. plots_images (directory) -> Output plots of A* and RRT algorithms. <br>
 Please keep these above seven items in one directory.

Run:
1. Open main.py
2. In the top USER EDITABLE section (line 9), you can set USE_Algo = 0 for A* and 1 for RRT. Set res = 0.5 (preferred).
3. In the rrtAlgo.py file, you can tune the edge lengths (Q = np.array([(2, 4), (1, 4)])) in line 16.
4. Run main.py. 
(Code takes around 20 sec for A* and less than 10 sec for RRT)
